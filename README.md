Project: MNIST Digit Classification Comparison Goal: Compare the performance of three different neural network architectures on handwritten digit recognition.

The Models & Results (5 Epochs):

Perceptron: A simple, single-layer model.

Accuracy: ~88%

Verdict: Fast but too simple for complex image data.

ANN (Artificial Neural Network): A multi-layer dense network.

Accuracy: ~96%

Verdict: Good improvement, but loses spatial information by flattening images too early.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Uses convolution and pooling layers.

Accuracy: ~98.7%

Verdict: The Winner. Effectively captures edges and shapes, making it ideal for image tasks.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib
